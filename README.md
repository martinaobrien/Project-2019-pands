#### Project-2019-pands
Using Fisher's Iris data set, research and using Python programme, document and conduct analysis the information investigated.

#### Objective of the Project
Using the well known Fisher Data set, research, investigate and summarise using Python programming to extract key statistics and trends from the set. 

#### Background Information to the Project
This well known dataset was collected in 1939 by Edgar Anderson consisting of three species of Iris: virginica, sertosa and versicolor.( http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris). It contains data on the five characteristics of the three species: petal length, petal width, sepal length, sepal width and the classification of the flower type. 

Two species of the data set were collected in the Gasle Pennisula, Quebec Canada by the same person, on the same day and analysed using the same apparatus. In total the dataset contains 50 types of each of the 3 species, 150 samples in total. The order in which the measurements were taken are sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width.

##### Prerequisites for the Project

For this project,  the following programmes were installed: 
 - Visual Studio Code with Python packages
 - Anaconda
 
 ##### Investigations on the Iris Data Set: 
 
 #### Two Dimensional Investigations
 
 
 #### Three Dimensional Investigations
 
 
 
 ##### Analysis and Summary of the Iris Dataset


You need to 
1.	Research ways to tackle the project
2.	Research background information
3.	Summaries the background data set
4.	Keep a reference list on all sources used in the project
5.	Download the data set
6.	Write some code to investigate it
7.	Summarise the date set: 
8.	maximum, minimum and mean of each column of the data set
9.	Write a summary of the investigatations using python
10.	Supporting Tables - labelled
11.	Graphics  - relevant

Train of thought: 
 •	Investigate and explain the data set to someone with no prior knowledge of the data
•	Explain what investigating the data set entails and how Python can be used to do it
•	Present a write up and code
•	Well organised and detailed explanations
•	Well conceived and examples of interesting analysis that others have pursued
